ESP32 WiFi Car Controller
This project allows you to control a car using an ESP32 over WiFi via a web-based joystick interface.

ðŸš€ Getting Started
1. Upload Code to ESP32
Upload esp32_wifi_car.ino to your ESP32 using the Arduino IDE or another compatible uploader.

2. Power and Boot ESP32
Power the ESP32 with 5V (use a step-down converter if needed).

Power the motor driver (BTS7960) with 12Vâ€“24V, depending on your motor specs.

3. Connect via WiFi
By default, the ESP32 starts in Access Point (AP) mode.

SSID: ORBITERBOOTHS

Password: 12345678

You can later modify the code to connect to a local WiFi network (STA mode).

4. Access the Controller
Open your browser and go to:

cpp
Copy
Edit

You'll see a control interface with:

A joystick to steer

A slider to control speed
